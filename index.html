                <h1>Functions <small>(are awesome)</small></h1>
                <p>Functions are mini-programs (within your big program) that you give
                    a name to. Then you can run them again &amp; again, just by
                    "calling" them.</p>

                <p>Functions are useful for breaking up a larger program into
                    smaller, "bite-sized" pieces, making things easier to understand.
                    Kind of like how chapters and headings divide up a textbook.</p>

                <p>Almost all programs you'll write and encounter will be made up
                    of many functions that "call" each other. Let's take a peek&hellip;</p>

                <section id="create-a-function" class="has-repl">
                    <h2>Creating &amp; Calling a Function</h2>
                    <p>Let's make a function called <code>shinerdog</code> that
                        howls annoyingly every time we call it.</p>
                    <p>Type this in the prompt on the right 
                        <small><em>(and press enter)</em></small>:</p>
                    <pre class="runnable">
function shinerdog() {
    alert("WOOOOooooOOoOOF!")
}
                    </pre>
                    <p>Nothing happened! That's OK. All that did is tell the computer, <br/>
                        "hey, I'm making this function called <code>shinerdog</code>".</p>
                    <p>Now run the function by calling it:
                        <pre class="runnable">shinerdog()</pre></p>

                    <p>Damn dog is always howling at people
                        <span class="smile"></span> <br/>
                        Let's make another function to tell him to stop:
                        <pre class="runnable">
function shut_up_shiner() {
    alert("SHINER! HUSH!")
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Tell him what's up:
                        <pre class="runnable">
shinerdog()
shut_up_shiner()
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p><small>*shiner slinks away &amp; curls up in a chair*</small></p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <h3>A less annoying <code>alert()</code></h3>
                            <p><code>alert()</code> is just a function like any other,
                                but it's one that comes
                                built-into the web browser. We can call <code>alert()</code> 
                                anytime we want to display something, but that popup 
                                window is annoying.</p>

                            <p>Instead &mdash; from here on out &mdash; 
                                we'll use its less-annoying cousin 
                                <code>console.log()</code>,
                                which will display its results in your prompt, 
                                instead of in an annoying popup window:</p>
                            <pre class="runnable">console.log("WAT!? O_o")</pre>

                <section id="inputs" class="has-repl">
                    <h2>Inputs <small>(make functions dance)</small></h2>
                    <p>That's the basics of creating and calling a function, but so far
                        our functions are of limited usefulness. A function that just
                        does the same thing over &amp; over is kind of pointless. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

                    <p>Let's do something a little more interesting.
                        Pretend we're organizing a conference, &amp; we want to
                        make a computer program that will print out name badges
                        for each of our guests.</p>

                    <p>Based on what we know so far, we could write 
                        a function that prints <br/>
                        <tt>Hello, my name is
                        __________</tt> &mdash; but that's no good. 
                        This is a fancy conference, so our badges need names, dammit!
                        Somehow, we have to tell our function the name of each guest, 
                        so it can print out <br/>
                        <tt>Hello, my name is Mike Jones</tt> instead.</p>
                    
                    <!-- TODO: note that "input" == "argument" || "parameter -->
                    <p>That's where <strong>inputs</strong> come in. A function can take 
                        an input, and then use that input in its code.</p>
                    
                    <p>This function takes an input called <code>guest_name</code>. Fill in the blank:
                        <pre class="runnable">
function print_badge(guest_name) {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + <span contenteditable="true">          </span>)
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Then when you call it, you "pass" it a value for its input:
                        <pre class="runnable">
print_badge("Mike Jones")
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p><small>(MIKE JONES! MIKE JONES!)</small></p>

                    <h3>Multiple Inputs</h3>
                    <p>Functions can also take more than one input (in theory, a function
                        could take a million inputs, but it would be a pain in the arse).
                    <p>Let's write another function to help with the conference.
                        This one will act as our doorman, and greet our guests as they
                        come in. We'd like him to not only greet them by name, but also
                        stroke their ego by giving them a compliment.</p>
                    <p>If the doorman is greeting Mike Jones,
                        age 37, he should say: <br/>
                        <tt>Hi there, Mike Jones!</tt><br/>
                        <tt>You don't look a day over 37!</tt>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fill in the missing code:
                        <pre class="runnable">
function greet_guest(guest_name, guest_age) {
    console.log("Hi there, " + <span contenteditable="true">          </span> + "!")
    console.log(<span contenteditable="true">                                              </span>)
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Got it? Now say Hi to Mike:
                        <pre class="runnable">
greet_guest("Mike Jones", 37)
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Our doorman sure is friendly, but he's also very stupid. Mike
                        Jones doesn't look older than 37, because he <em>isn't</em> older
                        than 37.</p>
                    <p><em>*sigh*</em> &mdash; Good help is hard to find. But
                        luckily, unlike people, we can easily make our program smarter 
                        <span class="smile"></span></p>
                </section>

                <section id="outputs" class="has-repl">
                    <h2>Outputs <small>(make computer programs "compute" stuff)</small></h2>
                    <p>Functions are useful for organizing our program, and we can pass
                        them inputs to make them do different things. Very cool, but
                        functions still have one big feature we haven't seen.</p>

                    <p>Not only can functions take in inputs, they can also "return"
                        an output that we can use somewhere else.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, there's a function (built-into the browser) called
                        <code>Math.round()</code> which will round any number up or down
                        to the nearest whole number, and "return" the new number.
                        Here's how we might use it:
                        <pre class="runnable">
var not_pi = Math.round(3.14159)
console.log(not_pi + " is close enough to PI for me!")
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Pretty simple, but also super-powerful.</p>

                    <h3>Back to the Doorman</h3>

                    <p>OK, let's see if we can make our stupid doorman a little bit
                        smarter. We want to make our guests feel good, so let's lie to 
                        them about how young they look. In fact, let's tell them they look
                        <strong>a decade younger</strong> than they actually are.
                        Flattery will get you everywhere
                        <span class="smile"></span></p>
                        
                    <p>To start with, we'll need a function that takes in a guest's real
                        age as input, and returns their "fake age" as output. So:</p>

                    <p><code>fake_age(40)</code> should return <code>30</code>.<br/>
                        <code>fake_age(34)</code> should return <code>24</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        <em>etc&hellip;</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>A function can "return" a value by using the keyword
                        &hellip; wait for it &hellip; <code>return</code>. &nbsp;I know, 
                        <img width=25 src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WpuYGqCEHDg/UBznzaqReKI/AAAAAAAAB_0/0Vc8_mnnhqw/s1600/mind-blown.gif">
                    </p>

                    <p>With all that in mind, fill in the missing part:
                        <pre class="runnable">
function a_decade_less_than(real_age) {
    return <span contenteditable="true">             </span>
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>And to test it out...
                        <pre class="runnable">
a_decade_less_than(34)
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Boosh! Now let's turn our doorman into a lying schmoozer.</p>

                    <h3>Lies, Sweet Lies</h3>
                    
                    <p>We'll use our same <code>greet_guest</code> function from before,
                        but this time it will use a "fake age" to
                        flatter the guest:
                        <pre class="runnable">
function greet_guest(guest_name, guest_age) {
    var fake_age = <span contenteditable="true">                             </span>
    console.log("Hi there, " + <span contenteditable="true">          </span> + "!") 
    console.log(<span contenteditable="true">                                       </span> + "!")
}
                        </pre>

                        <p>And now let's test it on our friend Mike Jones:
                            <pre class="runnable">greet_guest("Mike Jones", 37)</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>That's what I'm talking about. Now the guests will be in a
                            good mood when we ask them for donations later
                            <span class="smile">P</span></p>
                </section>

                <section id="foreach" class="has-repl">
                    <h2>Functions + Lists <small>(a killer combo)</small></h2>
                    <p>Lists, like functions, are a common thing to find in programs. A
                        list is extremely simple: it's just a comma-separated <em>list</em>
                        of things, placed between square brackets, (these things: <code>[ ]</code>).
                    </p>

                    <p>Here's an example:
                        <pre class="runnable">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</pre></p>

                    <p>&hellip; and another:
                        <pre class="runnable">[1, 2, 3, "shiner is an", "insane-o dog"]</pre></p>

                    <p>Lists are cool, and there's a lot to learn about them. But for now,
                        let's just focus on how they interact with functions.</p>

                    <p>The most common thing we'll want to do with a list is run
                        some function <strong>for each</strong> thing inside the list.</p>

                    <p>The way to do that is using a built-in function called
                        &hellip; wait for it &hellip; <code>forEach()</code>.
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;I know, 
                        <img width=25 src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WpuYGqCEHDg/UBznzaqReKI/AAAAAAAAB_0/0Vc8_mnnhqw/s1600/mind-blown.gif">
                    </p>

                    <p><code>forEach</code> takes <em>the name of a function</em> as input. Here's an example: 
                        Remember our old annoying friend, the function called <code>alert</code>?
                        Here's how you run <code>alert</code> <em>for each</em> thing inside a list:<br/>
                        <small><em>(warning: this will be annoying<span class="smile">P</span> )</em></small>
                        <pre class="runnable">
var my_list = [1, 2, 3, "shiner"]
my_list.forEach(alert)
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Back to the Conference</h3>

                    <p>The conference is coming up soon, so it's time to prepare.
                        Let's print badges for each guest in our list:
                        <pre class="runnable">
<span style="opacity:0.5">// Remember earlier, we created:
// function print_badge(guest_name) { ... }</span>

var guest_list = [
    "<span contenteditable="true">               </span>",
    "<span contenteditable="true">               </span>",
    "<span contenteditable="true">               </span>"
]

// Print badges for each guest:
<span contenteditable="true">          </span>.<span contenteditable="true">       </span>(<span contenteditable="true">           </span>)
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>BOOM!</p>

                    <p><code>forEach()</code> will come in handy very often, so it's
                        a good idea to get your head wrapped around it. If you're still a little unclear
                        on how it works, feel free to play around with it some more, or shoot me (or any dev)
                        a HipChat message.

                    <p>One cool (somewhat advanced) thing we can do with functions is
                        have them call themself. This is called "recursion".

                    <p>Here's a very basic example of recursion. This function will 
                        count down to 0, by calling itself again &amp; again:
                        <pre class="runnable highlight">
function count_down(x) {
    // first thing, let's display our number
    console.log(x)

    if (x == 0)
        return  // we hit 0. time to stop!
    else
        // call ourself again, but this time with one less
        return count_down(x - 1)
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Try it:
                        <pre class="runnable">count_down(10)</pre>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bonus Puzzle</h3>
                    <p>There's a very famous example of recursion: the fibonacci
                        numbers. You may recognize them:
                        <pre>1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21 ...</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Each fibonacci number in the sequence is made by adding
                        the 2 previous numbers in the sequence. So to find the
                        6th number, we add up the 4th + 5th numbers:
                        <pre>1st   2nd   3rd   4th     5th     6th

 1     1     2     3  (+)  5  (=)  8</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Now the puzzle: Can you write a recursive function called <code>fib</code>
                        that calculates a particular number in the sequence?</p>

                    <p>Once you've written it, use these to see if it's working correctly:
                        <pre class="runnable highlight">fib(8) // should display 21</pre>
                        <pre class="runnable highlight">fib(10) // should display 55</pre>
                        <pre class="runnable highlight">fib(41) // should display 165580141, after thinking a while</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p><small>This can be tricky. Don't worry if it's difficult.</small></p>
                    <p><small><a style="cursor:context-menu;" onclick="$('#fibhint').show().parent().show()">Click here</a> if you <em>really want a hint.</em></small>
                        <pre style="display:none;" id="fibhint" class="runnable">function fib(x) {
    if (<span contenteditable="true">     </span>)
        return <span contenteditable="true">          </span> + <span contenteditable="true">          </span>
    else
        return <span contenteditable="true"> </span>
}
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Functions are Cool</h2>

                    <p>We've only scratched the surface of the cool ways we can use
                        functions. Not only can we write functions that call other
                        functions and themselves, we can write functions that take other
                        functions as input, and functions that return
                        a function (which - in turn - return another function, etc&hellip;).
                        We can even write functions that take in <em>code</em> as an
                        input, and then modify the code and/or run it. (The prompt on the
                        right side is powered by one such function.)
                    </p>

                    <p>Functions are the backbone of modern programming. As you
                        continue to program, you'll learn more and more ways
                        you can use functions. I still learn more to this day.

                    <h2>Keep Playing Around</h2>
                    <p>You can try different things as much as you want in the prompt on the right.
                        If you'd prefer, you can also press <code>Cmd + Alt + J</code> to open
                        up the browser's Developer Tools, where you'll have a full-blown, real-life
                        development environment (we use the Developer Tools a lot - every day, and
                        sometimes for hours on end!)
