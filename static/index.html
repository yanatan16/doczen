                <h1>Functions <small>(are awesome)</small></h1>
                <p>Functions are mini-programs (within your big program) that you give
                    a name to. Then you can run them again &amp; again, just by
                    "calling" them.</p>

                <p>Functions are useful for breaking up a larger program into
                    smaller, "bite-sized" pieces, making things easier to understand.
                    Kind of like how chapters and headings divide up a textbook.</p>

                <p>Almost all programs you'll write and encounter will be made up
                    of many functions that "call" each other. Let's take a peek&hellip;</p>

                    <h2>Creating &amp; Calling a Function</h2>
                    <p>Let's make a function called <code>shinerdog</code> that
                        prints out "woooof!" every time we call it.</p>
                    <p>Type this in the prompt on the right (&amp; hit enter):</p>
                    <pre>
function shinerdog() {
    console.log("WOOOOF!")
}</pre>
                    <p>Nothing happened! [[MORE WORDS HERE]]</p>
                    <p>Try typing this into the prompt :
                        <pre>shinerdog()</pre></p>
                    <p>Now run it again. And again.

                    <p>In the past few months several new apps have let people pay to get reservations at restaurants where tables are in a great demand. Some essentially scalp reservations. With others, like Resy, the restaurants themselves sell reservations.  Are these services a useful way to let people get into popular restaurants, or are they just another way for restaurants to sell something that was once free?</p>
